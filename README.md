## Getting Started

There we provided few code examples from our previous projects.

## Technologies:

- React
- Typescript
- Next.js

## Structure

In the `src` folder you can find our code examples:

- `src/components` folder there we have added few components that we created previously.
Note: Components are from different projects.
- `src/pages` there we have added one Next.js page example
- `src/typings` type declarations
- `src/utils` custom hooks and utility functions
